* NOTICE: for those of you that came late: we will start at 9:00 the coming days
* NOTICE: the lunch break will be apprx. one hour, instead of 1.5

* Notes:

  * To use anaconda you need to modify the ``PATH`` environment variable.
  * ``anaconda_on`` is something specific to my machine, sorry for the
    confusion.
  * There is a bug with the ``UTF-8 locale`` on OSX and the IPython notebook
    and a fix is available.
  * The Ipython notebook is buggy on windows and will note work :(.
